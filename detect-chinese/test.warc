Rated 5 out of 5  by DrOdd cool effect We put this flicker flame bulb in a candle-like holder and have it on a side board for a night light. Looks so cool flickering in the dark and gives enough light to see in the middle of the night. January 28, 2013 Rated 5 out of 5 So classy and old fashioned! I used these bulbs in my Christmas wedding, and they were such a hit! The flickering light gave off just enough light, and made the church feel warm and cozy. We were married in an old church, so these bulbs in the converted gas lamps were perfect!!! I would definitely recommend these for anyone who wants an ambiance of warm candle light. However, make sure you have secondary lighting as these bulbs aren't designed to be bright for seeing.
